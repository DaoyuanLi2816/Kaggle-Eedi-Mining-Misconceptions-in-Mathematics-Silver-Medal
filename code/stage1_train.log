QUERY:
<instruct>Given a math question and its incorrect answer, identify the underlying misconception that led to the mistake.
<query>### Construct
Recognise a quadratic graph from its shape
### Subject
Quadratic Graphs-Others
### Question
Tom and Katie are discussing quadratic graphs Tom says this could be the graph of a quadratic function ![A graph showing a positive parabola in the shape of a u]() Katie says this could be the graph of a quadratic function ![A graph showing a negative parabola in the shape of an upside down u]() Who is correct?
### Correct Answer
Both Tom and Katie
### Wrong Answer
Only Katie
